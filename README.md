# Fraud_Detection
This is a final project for my Computer Engineering degree. Consists on the creation of two models for fraud transaction detection, one is done with Ethereum accounts data from kaggle and the other one from JP Morgan synthetic data from their AI research team. Also I did  the design of the implementation of the model in a Ethereum smart contract.

The JP Morgan related code is not public due to confidentality issues.
